                <p>My passion for technology first sparked when I was in the 7th grade living in the suburbs of
                    Atlanta. My best friend and his older brother were really into PC gaming. They invited me over for
                    a LAN party, which at the time was such a foreign concept to me and to my foreign parents. I came
                    over to his house with my eMachines desktop, an LCD monitor, mouse, and keyboard. I looked around
                    and everyone else had their own custom built PCs. Everyone was more than happy to talk about their
                    machine and from there my interest had sparked.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Fast-forward to college. At this point, I had built many machines for my friends and family and
                    really enjoyed working with my hands. I graduated with my degree in Mechanical Engineering from The
                    Georgia Institute of Technology. I spent the next year as a Design Engineer, using computer-aided
                    design software. After that I joined a medical device company working as a Rotational Engineer.
                    During that time, I got the opportunity to live in three different cities all in different states,
                    Colorado, Massachusetts, and Connecticut.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> During my time as a Rotational Engineer, I discovered that my favorite projects were the projects
                    that involved innovation or projects that I would provide innovative solutions to. Then it dawned
                    on me that my true passion is in technology, which has led me back to Atlanta to gain my
                    certification in Full-Stack Web Development at The Georgia Institute of Technology.
